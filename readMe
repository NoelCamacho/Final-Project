At the beginning of this project, I had a text based fighting game/fighting game with graphics in mind
After attempting to create both of these projects, I discovered that I am not knowledged enough to make such games.
I finally decided to make a text based adventure game.
My text based adventure game is about you crash landing with no knowledge of anything that happened to you
Through radio you find a man named Smith. You travel to the neighboring planet to rescue him
After some decisive decisions, you either make it to him and escape, or get stranded and die.
Some things that I learned during this project was time management. Honestly, my time management was very bad and I feel as if I could have done better work
Coding wise, I learned more about while loops and their importance
